/*
The menu breaks at 1024 pixels wide.

At exactly 1024px width the menu items display at different widths (see
screenshots 03_, 04_, and 05_. This happens because the max width of 1024 is
still in effect when the min width of 1024px has already started (see
03_prog_enhance_breaks_at_1024px). The CSS overlaps.

The fix is to come into into this file, styles.scss. Then do the following
calculation:

  (64rem x 16px/rem) + 1 = 1025px.

Get the new rem value by taking 1025px/16px/rem = 64.0625rem.

Change this line...

  @media only screen and (min-width: 64rem) {

to this:

  @media only screen and (min-width: 64.0625rem) {

This fixes the overlap problem.
