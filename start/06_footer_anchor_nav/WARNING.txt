REASONS FOR USING THIS SOLUTION

The navigation takes over the whole screen giving your room for more links

This solution doesn't require any JavaScript.

He also likes the Open/Close labels on the hamburger button.

WARNING

There's a problem with my solution.  On small viewports, the menu appears at both the top and
bottom of the screen.  He prefers this solution since it worked on every device he tests with.
If you try to emulate it, you should compare your index and scss files to his to try to determine
why you're seeing the navigation at the bottom on small viewports.
